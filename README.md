# Tecs

Tecs is a modular and testable Entity-Component-System framework for JavaScript games, with first-class TypeScript support.

**This project is still in the early stages of development. Do not use at this time.** The core packages and APIs are currently being drafted.

## Features

* Modular - use only the packages you need alongside the core framework
* Agnostic - although most of the additional packages are geared towards `CanvasRenderingContext2D`, the core module can be used with any technology
* Testable - easily verify systems logic using your favourite unit testing tools
* Bandwidth-friendly - all packages are published as ES Modules, and have no external dependencies for optimal tree-shaking
* Statically-typed - all packages are shipped with TypeScript declarations

More info and documentation is on the way.
